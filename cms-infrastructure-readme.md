# CMS Infrastructure

This repository contains the infrastructure as code (IaC) and deployment configurations for our Content Management System (CMS) project.

## Repository Contents

- `kubernetes/`: Kubernetes manifests and configurations
- `helm-charts/`: Helm charts for deploying services
- `ci-cd/`: CI/CD pipeline configurations (e.g., GitHub Actions workflows)
- `terraform/`: Terraform scripts for provisioning cloud resources (if applicable)

## Prerequisites

- kubectl
- helm
- Docker
- A Kubernetes cluster (e.g., minikube for local development, or a cloud-based cluster)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/cms-infrastructure.git
   cd cms-infrastructure
   ```

2. Set up your Kubernetes context to point to your desired cluster.

3. Create necessary namespaces:
   ```
   kubectl create namespace cms-dev
   kubectl create namespace cms-staging
   kubectl create namespace cms-prod
   ```

## Deploying Services

To deploy a service using Helm:

```
helm upgrade --install <service-name> ./helm-charts/<service-name> -n <namespace>
```

For example, to deploy the content service to the development namespace:

```
helm upgrade --install content-service ./helm-charts/content-service -n cms-dev
```

## CI/CD Pipelines

Our CI/CD pipelines are configured using GitHub Actions. The workflow files are located in the `ci-cd/` directory. These workflows handle:

- Building and pushing Docker images
- Running tests
- Deploying to different environments (dev, staging, prod)

## Monitoring and Logging

We use Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring, and the ELK stack for logging. Configurations for these tools can be found in their respective directories under `kubernetes/`.

## Security

- Ensure all sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords) are stored as Kubernetes secrets.
- Regularly update and patch all components.
- Follow the principle of least privilege when setting up service accounts and RBAC.
